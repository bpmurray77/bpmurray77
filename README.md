## About Me ðŸ‘‹

I have had a lifelong interest in technology and have spent several years writing tech articles ranging from software reviews to hardware guides. Now, I am looking to move forward in my career and apply my passion for problem solving as a software developer. I have experience in front and backend development with JavaScript, Python, React, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, SQL, Flask, REST APIs and Git. I aim to create applications and websites that are both pleasing to use and highly functional.
